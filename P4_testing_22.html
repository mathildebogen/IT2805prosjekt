    <h1>P4: Testing of the website</h1>
    <h2>Mathilde Wessman Bogen, Ane Solbakken-Melleby, Julie Hoven, Anna Skogseth and Solveig Davies Vitters√∏, 11.11.22</h2>
    <h3>Administrative details</h3>
    <p>The name of your client, and his or her position in the
        organization (or company), if applicable.</p>

    <h3>Testing document</h3>
    <p>A brief summary of the questionnaire you send out to testers, as
        well as the link to the Google Form you used. Don't forget to ask your client to test
        the website.</p>

    <h3>Tester Audience</h3>
    <p>A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the
        website's intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of
        your tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% of college
        students, 46% school administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges, you can
        do the same. If you were able to do live testing with a few users, describe that as
        well.</p>

    <h3>Testing platforms</h3>
    <p>A summary of the different platforms (devices and browsers) that
        your testers used.</p>

    <h3>Feedback Summary</h3>
    <p>A summary of the feedback you received organized by
        question type (design, navigation, content, usability, etc.). Highlight both positive
        comments and thoughtful criticism, your client's testimonial, etc.</p>

    <h3>Our response</h3>
    <p>Provide your response to the feedback. Concretely, describe what
        you could do (once the class is over) to address this feedback with changes in your
        design or implementation. You can also address why some of the raised issues or
        suggestions for improvements are difficult or impossible to tackle.</p>

    <h3>Self-reflection</h3>
    <p>Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you
        learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the
        nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? We would like you to take this
        seriously and be thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong
        answer here, so don't feel that you have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to
        hear.</p>
