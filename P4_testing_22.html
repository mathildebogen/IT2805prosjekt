    <h1>P4: Testing of the website</h1>
    <h2>Mathilde Wessman Bogen, Ane Solbakken-Melleby, Julie Hoven, Anna Skogseth and Solveig Davies Vittersø, 11.11.22</h2>
    <h2>Administrative details</h2>
    <p>Torsdagsbar, the student organization made up of architecture 
        and design is our client. We did not actually contact the group. </p>


    <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
    <p>We tested our website on three people. They were all students because 
        this is our user group and our website is for students. 
        Two of them were industrial design students and one of them was a 
        building engineer student. We tested two men and one woman. </p>

    <h2>Testing platforms</h2>
    <p>Our testers used safari and chrome when testing, and tested directly 
        from their computers. We stood next to them and took notes of their navigation, 
        as well as asking them some follow-up questions after the test was over.</p>

    <h2>A brief summary of the usertesting</h2>
    <p>Test 1: We got feedback that the footer was a bit too big and that the 
        window with google maps in the footer could have been in the “about us”-page instead. 
        It was a padding that covered one of the links in the navbar on the front page so that the link did not work. 
        The user did not understand that the links on the drinks-page could be clicked to see the recipes. 
        He did not understand that the animation only happens when you hover over the glass. 
        He said that the website looked good and that the fonts and pictures were nice. </p>

        <p>Test 2: From this test we did not get too many comments. She liked the color theme 
            and the picture carousel at the startpage. She navigated easily through the webpage,
             but he did not understand that the animation needed to be hovered over to start.</p> 

        <p>Test 3: The third tester thought the pictures were cool, but wanted the picture carousel 
            to swipe automatically. He also did not understand that the drink was an animation to begin with. 
            He wanted the drink-recipes to open in a new tab. He also thought the “Torsdagsbar” heading at the 
            frontpage scaled weird. He overall liked the style on the website. 
        </p>

    <h2>Our response</h2>
    <p>The feedback from usertesting was helpful, even though some of the comments were expected. 
        Since we have been working on this project over a few weeks, we got used to the website, 
        and it was easy to overlook some flaws. These were pointed out by the testers. </p>

       <p> Whilst others were more difficult to do anything with. For example the animation 
        could have been used as a loading icon instead as originally planned, but it was too 
        difficult for us to synchronize with an element that might take time to load.
        </p>
        <p>When it comes to the picture carousel swapping images on delay, 
            we wanted to show two different javascript functions, as the animation would have 
            basically done the same. Therefore we have stuck to the navigation buttons below the images.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            We made the links open in new tabs based on the feedback from user testing.
            </p>

    <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
    <p>We have learnt a lot from this project, both in terms of getting to know the tools in depth, 
        and working together on the same codebase. Synchronizing the way we code language-wise and 
        trying to avoid merge-conflicts in GitHub was a valuable frist-time lesson for us all. 
        It was fun to see the site come to life and test the skills we have built up during this semester, 
        finding that we knew more than we originally thought! A nice boost to have with us in to the exam in december. </p>

       <p> Other than that, it has been a really fun project compared to the other IT-subjects, as it was very 
        learning-by-doing based. It has also shown us how useful it is to have a good prototype to visualize 
        what you are going to make, before making it.
        </p>
