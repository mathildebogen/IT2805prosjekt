        <h3>Purpose and goals</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of the website is to give all the information you need about Torsdagsbar. 
            The webpage is supposed to wake interest for the events - this will be achieved by having a well structured page for upcoming and previous events. 
            We will also try to attract our target group by having an appealing UI to summon those design-geeks. 
            We want to make it easy for anyone who is interested in the events to find out when, where and what to meet up for! Our goal is that every student from architecture and industrial design knows what torsdagsbar is because of our amazing website!
        </p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            The intended audience is architecture and design students who are interested in getting to know people from different fields of study. 
            These students are creative people who expect the website to be nice looking and well organized, and include inspiring and playful events. 
            They need quick access to see what events are up next, buy drink vouchers, and sign up to the group.
